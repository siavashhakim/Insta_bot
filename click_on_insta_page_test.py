Line 5 sets five seconds of waiting time. If Selenium canâ€™t find an element, then it waits for five seconds to allow everything to load and tries again.
Line 9 finds the element <a> whose text is equal to Log in. It does this using XPath, but there are a few other methods you could use.
Line 10 clicks on the found element <a> for the login link.
